          <span>My Maharani,</span>
          <br />
          On this Rose Day, I want to share my feelings with you, even though my love may be one-sided. Your presence brings happiness and warmth into my life. Like a beautiful rose, your beauty captures my heart. The red roses symbolize the passion I feel for you. In life's garden, you're the most special flower to me. Thank you for being my inspiration and the reason behind my love. Our journey together, even if it's just from my side, is as sweet as the scent of roses. Happy Rose Day, my Maharani. Here's to the beauty of shared laughter, blossoming with each passing moment. A Rose you can keep without anyone knowing you have one...         <br />
